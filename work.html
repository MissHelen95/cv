      <p class="description">Self-hosted WordPress website<br>This band was looking
        for a volunteer to keep the content on their website up to date. I changed
        the WordPress theme so that the home page included a side bar where the
      details of the bands concerts could be see clearly by users.</p>

      <p class="description">WordPress website<br>The previous website hadn't been updated since it was
        first created years ago. I asked if I could update the layout and made a
        PowerPoint presentation of my ideas and reasons for my choices. The update
        involved finding a new WordPress theme which would work best for the sites
        purpose and was especially user friendly. Now I periodically update the
        content.</p>
